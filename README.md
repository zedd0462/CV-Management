# CV-Management

Welcome to the CV Management App! This application allows you to manage CVs with a common format, create new CVs, view them with multiple styles, and search for CVs by various criteria such as name and technology. The app is built with pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and uses a JavaScript file as its database.
